He was attentive and he and his staff\n listened to concerns or questions and addressed them professionally.  \nDr. Styrt saw my children at every visit and gave me an update on their \ntreatment each visit \u2026 We found them VERY patient oriented and it shows \nthroughout their entire office, starting with the complimentary hot \ncoffee and designer teas, snacks, warm scented hand cremes. My kids want\n to run down the hall to get to their video game room and books and \nmagazines.
