Generally, \northodontic treatment will take about two years, and this is for good \nreason. During this time, your teeth will slowly move into their desired\n positions, leaving you with a great smile with as little discomfort as \npossible. Rushing treatment can result in a less than perfect smile with\n a greater chance of tooth movement after your treatment is complete. At\n Dr. Paul J. Styrt, Specialists in Orthodontics &amp; Pediatric \nDentistry, we don\u2019t want to waste your time with treatment that won\u2019t \nretain your smile for the rest of your life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, treatment time will vary depending on your specific \nsituation. Very minor tooth movement may only take a few months to \ncorrect, while serious malocclusion (poor bite) may need more than two \nyears to correct. Only Dr. Styrt will be able to accurately estimate the\n time your treatment will take. But trust us\u2014it\u2019ll all be worth it in \nthe end!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Has your child or teen visited our San Diego office for a \ncomplimentary consultation? If not, please give us a call and let us \nhelp him or her begin the journey to a gorgeous smile!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Your smile is totally unique, so the time you\u2019ll need to spend undergoing orthodontic treatment will also be unique.
